## Detailed Platform Analysis

### 1. Cloudflare Workers ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Pros:**
- Best free tier (100k requests/day)
- Fastest cold starts (~5ms)
- Global edge network (200+ locations)
- Excellent DX with Wrangler CLI
- Built-in KV storage for caching
- WebAssembly support for future optimizations

**Cons:**

**Example Deployment:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### 4. AWS Lambda

**Pros:**
- Most generous free tier (1M requests/month)
- Mature ecosystem
- Extensive service integrations
- Flexible runtime options
- No vendor lock-in concerns

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Higher cold starts
- Requires API Gateway for HTTP
- More operational overhead

**Best For:**
- Enterprise deployments
- Complex architectures
- AWS ecosystem integration

**Example Deployment:**
```bash
# Using SAM CLI
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

## Recommendations by Use Case

### For Maximum Free Usage
**Choose: Cloudflare Workers**
- 100k requests/day vs others' monthly limits
- Lowest operational costs
- Best performance

### For Easiest Setup
**Choose: Netlify Functions**
- Simplest deployment process
- Great local development
- No configuration complexity

### For Enterprise/Scale
**Choose: AWS Lambda**
- Most flexibility
- Best integration options
- Proven at scale

### For Edge Performance
**Choose: Cloudflare Workers**
- Global edge network
- Lowest latency
- Best geographic distribution

## Cost Analysis (Monthly)

Assuming 10,000 requests/day (300,000/month):

| Platform | Free Tier Coverage | Estimated Cost |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Cloudflare Workers | 100% (3M requests free) | $0 |
| Netlify Functions | 41% (125k free) | ~$20 |
| Vercel | 33% (100k free) | ~$40 |
| AWS Lambda | 100% (1M free) | $0 |

## Technical Constraints Impact

### Memory Requirements
Uroman's data files are approximately 15-20MB when loaded:
- **Cloudflare**: May hit 128MB limit with large batch operations
- **Others**: Comfortable headroom at 1GB+

### Execution Time
Typical romanization takes <100ms:
- All platforms handle this well
- Batch operations may need optimization for Cloudflare

### Bundle Size
Uroman + dependencies ≈ 25MB:
- All platforms handle this size
- May need optimization for faster cold starts

## Migration Strategy

The adapter pattern allows easy migration between platforms:

```typescript
// Easy to switch platforms
import adapter from './adapters/cloudflare';
// import adapter from './adapters/netlify';
// import adapter from './adapters/vercel';

export default adapter;
```

## Conclusion

**Start with Cloudflare Workers** for the best free tier and performance. The architecture supports easy migration to other platforms as needs evolve.

### Quick Decision Matrix

- **Free tier priority**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Ease of use priority**: Netlify Functions  
- **Enterprise features**: AWS Lambda
- **Edge performance**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Existing Next.js app**: Vercel
