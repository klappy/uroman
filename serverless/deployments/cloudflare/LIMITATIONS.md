# Cloudflare Workers Limitations for Uroman

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Cloudflare Workers is NOT suitable for uroman

After extensive testing and optimization attempts, we've determined that Cloudflare Workers cannot support uroman due to fundamental platform limitations.

## üö´ Key Limitations

### 1. Python Support Issues

- **Experimental Python**: Cloudflare's Python support (via Pyodide) is experimental and severely limited
- **No `regex` module**: The powerful `regex` library used by uroman is not available
- **Limited `re` module**: Python's standard `re` module lacks the Unicode property support needed for uroman
- **Incomplete Unicode support**: Missing critical Unicode normalization and character property functions

### 2. Size Constraints

- **10MB limit**: Workers have a strict 10MB compressed size limit
- **Uroman's size**: Even with optimizations, uroman + dependencies = 13-15MB
- **Unicode data**: The Unicode tables alone are several MB

### 3. Failed Optimization Attempts

We tried multiple approaches to make it work:

#### Attempt 1: Compile and Upload

```
‚ùå Result: 13-15MB (exceeds 10MB limit)
```

#### Attempt 2: Extract Unicode Tables to KV Store

```javascript
// Tried storing Unicode data in Cloudflare KV
const unicodeData = await env.UNICODE_KV.get("UnicodeData.txt");
const props = await env.UNICODE_KV.get("UnicodeDataProps.txt");
```

‚ùå Result: Still too large, and performance would be slower due to KV latency

#### Attempt 3: Strip Down Libraries

- Removed all non-essential code
- Eliminated unused Unicode scripts
- Compressed data structures
  ‚ùå Result: Lost critical functionality, still over 10MB

#### Attempt 4: WebAssembly Approach

- Considered compiling to WASM
- Would require complete rewrite
  ‚ùå Result: WASM binary would likely exceed size limits too

## üìä Comparison with Other Platforms

| Feature         | Cloudflare Workers | Modal.ai        | AWS Lambda       |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Size Limit      | 10MB               | No limit        | 250MB (unzipped) |
| Python Support  | Experimental       | Native          | Native           |
| Unicode Support | Limited            | Full            | Full             |
| Regex Library   | Basic only         | Full            | Full             |
| Cold Start      | <1s                | 5-10s           | 1-5s             |
| Best For        | Simple APIs        | ML/AI workloads | General compute  |

## üéØ Recommendation

**DO NOT attempt to deploy uroman on Cloudflare Workers.**

Instead, use:

- **Modal.ai** ‚úÖ - Best for this use case (no size limits, full Python)
- **AWS Lambda** ‚úÖ - Good alternative (250MB limit is sufficient)
- **Google Cloud Functions** ‚úÖ - Similar to AWS Lambda
- **Azure Functions** ‚úÖ - Similar to AWS Lambda

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Check platform limitations early** - Would have saved weeks of effort
2. **Size matters** - Unicode-heavy applications need generous size limits
3. **Python support varies** - "Python support" doesn't mean full Python
4. **Edge computing has trade-offs** - Fast cold starts come at the cost of functionality

## üîß If You Must Use Cloudflare...

Consider these alternatives:

1. **Proxy to another service**: Use CF Workers as a proxy to Modal/Lambda
2. **Subset functionality**: Implement only specific scripts (not universal)
3. **Different approach**: Use transliteration libraries designed for edge computing

## üìù Technical Details

### Why uroman needs so much space:

```
uroman/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UnicodeData.txt (1.8MB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UnicodeDataProps.txt (2.1MB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ romanization-table.txt (1.2MB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Chinese_to_Pinyin.txt (0.9MB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (more data files)
Total: ~8MB of critical data files alone
```

### Why regex is critical:

```python
# uroman uses advanced regex features:
regex.match(r'\p{Script=Arabic}', char)  # Unicode script properties
regex.sub(r'(?<=\p{L})\p{M}+', '', text)  # Unicode categories
# Standard 're' module can't do this!
```

## üöÄ Migration Path

If you started with Cloudflare Workers:

1. Use our Modal.ai deployment (see `/serverless/deployments/modal/`)
2. Your API structure can remain the same
3. You'll get better performance and full functionality
4. Cost is comparable for most use cases

---

**Bottom line**: Cloudflare Workers is amazing for simple edge computing, but uroman's Unicode processing requirements make it incompatible with CF's constraints. Use Modal.ai or AWS Lambda instead.
